Q1)What is the body parser used for?

ans-To handle HTTP POST requests in Express.js version 4 and above, you need to install the middleware module called body-parser.
    body-parser extracts the entire body portion of an incoming request stream and exposes it on req.body.
    The middleware was a part of Express.js earlier but now you have to install it separately.
    This body-parser module parses the JSON, buffer, string and URL encoded data submitted using HTTP POST request.
